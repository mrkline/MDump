MDump has two modes: merge and split. In merge mode, MDump takes individual
images and combines them into merged images, making it easy to upload lots of images
at once. In the other mode, split mode, it takes these merged images and splits them
back into individual images using information saved in the comment text. This allows
someone who downloaded the merged image to easily split it back up.

To merge images, simply drag images you want to merge in to the list or add them
with the "Add Images" button, then click on the merge button. You can drag entire
folders in as well. Images in the folder will be added.  You can also create
folders manually.

To split images, drag them in to the list or add them with the "Add Images"
button, and click the split button.

To change options, click the "Options button." They will be saved in an XML
file in the same directory as the program.

PNGOps.dll must be kept in the same folder as MDump.exe
